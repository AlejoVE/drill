# Drill



## Motivation

This project was developed as an CSS exercise, as part of the web development training at [BeCode Liege](https://github.com/becodeorg).

## What I did
- Three buttons animated on hover.
- To expand the second button without touching the width, I used the property: ```transform: scale(1.2, 1.2);```
- To move the third button, I used the property: ```transform: translateX(100px);```

## Challenges I faced
I had no knowledge of the ```transform```, so it took me some time, after a lot of research, to come up with that solution.

At first I had a bad approach, I was trying to animate the buttons with animations.
